Cascade attribute is mandatory, when ever we apply relationship between objects, 
cascade attribute transfers operations done on one object onto its related child objects

If we write cascade = “all” then changes at parent class object will be effected to child class object too,  
if we write cascade = “all” then all operations like insert, delete, update at parent object will be effected to child object also
default value of cascade =”none” means no operations will be transfers to the child class

Cascade having the values…….

    none (default)
    save
    update
    save-update
    delete
    all
    all-delete-orphan
    
    
what is orphan record ..?
an orphan record means it is a record in child table but it doesn’t have association with its parent in the application.
