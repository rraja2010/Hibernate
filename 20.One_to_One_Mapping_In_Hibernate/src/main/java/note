    Hibernate One to One Mapping
    --------------------------------------
One object is associated with one object only
    In this relationship, one object of the one pojo class contains association with one object of the 
    	another pojo class
    
    To apply one to one relationship between two pojo class objects it is possible by without taking a 
    	separate foreign key column in the child table of the database
    
    To apply one to one relationship, we copy the primary key value of parent object into primary key 
    	value of the child object.  So that the relationship between two objects is one to one
    
    If we want to copy parent object primary key value into child object primary key, we need to use a 
    	special generator class given by hibernate called foreign
    
    Actually this foreign generator is only used in one to one relationship only
    
    We are going to apply one to one between student and address pojo classes, here the relation is 
    	one address is assigned for one student only
    
    In order to get one to one relationship between student and address, we are copying primary key 
    	value of student into primary key value of address
