Hibernate Versioning
*********************
Once an object is saved in a database, we can modify that object any number of times right, 
	If we want to know how many no of times that an object is modified then we need to apply this versioning concept.
	
When ever we use versioning then hibernate inserts version number as zero, when ever object is saved for the first time in the database. 
 	Later hibernate increments that version no by one automatically when ever a modification is done on that particular object.
In order to use this versioning concept, we need the following two changes in our application


Add one property of type int in our pojo class

public class Person {
	private int id;
	private String firstname;
	private String lastname;
	
	private int ver;// it will store the versionid	
}

In hibernate mapping file, add an element called version soon after id element
<version name="ver" column="ver" />
