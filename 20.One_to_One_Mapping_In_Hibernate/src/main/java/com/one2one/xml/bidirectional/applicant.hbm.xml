	Applicant_Id column is the primary key of Applicant table

	We have defined one to one mapping with Passport entity using “one-to-one” tag.

	We have also provided cascade attribute value as “save-update” which means whenever we save or update Applicant record

	Passport_Id column is the primary key of Passport table
	
	We have specified Primary key as passportId and generator class as “foreign”.

	Generator class “foreign” indicates that Primary key of Passport table will be coming from Applicant 
		table and we have to use the property name as same as relation name which is “applicant”.

	We have defined one to one mapping with Applicant entity using “one-to-one” tag.

	We have also provided “constrained” as true which specifies that a foreign key constraint on the primary 
		key of the mapped table and references the table of the associated class.

  `Passport_Id` int NOT NULL,
