****************************
By this inheritance strategy, we can map the whole hierarchy by single table only. 
	Here, an extra column (also known as discriminator column) is created in the table to identify the class.

	
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE), @DiscriminatorColumn and 
	@DiscriminatorValue annotations for mapping table per hierarchy strategy.
