Hibernate Caching Mechanism, Hibernate Cache
********************************************
Every fresh session having its own cache memory, Caching is a mechanism for storing the loaded objects into a cache memory.  

The advantage of cache mechanism is, whenever again we want to load the same object from the database 

then instead of hitting the database once again, it loads from the local cache memory only,so that the no. of round trips between 
	an application and a database server got decreased.  

It means caching mechanism increases the performance of the application.

In hibernate we have two levels of caching
-----------------------------------------------

First Level Cache [ or ] Session Cache
Second Level Cache [ or ] Session Factory Cache [ or  ] JVM Level Cache

First Level Cache
****************
By default, for each hibernate application, the first level cache is automatically been enabled
As a programmer, we no need to have any settings to enable the first level cache and also we cannot disable this first level cache
the first level cache is associated with the session object and scope of the cache is limited to one session only

When we load an object for the first time from the database then the object will be loaded from the database and the loaded object 
	will be stored in the cache memory maintained by that session object. 

If we load the same object once again, with in the same session, then the object will be loaded from the local cache memory not 
	from the database
If we load the same object by opening other session then again the object will loads from the database and the loaded object 
	will be stored in the cache memory maintained by this new session
